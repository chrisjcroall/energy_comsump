A Time Series is a Python-based machine learning project focused on time series forecasting for Energy Consumption using the powerful XGBoost algorithm. The project encompasses various essential steps, beginning with data preprocessing to handle missing values, eliminate duplicates, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

Feature engineering techniques are applied to extract valuable information and create new features that capture temporal patterns. Lag features and rolling statistics are generated to provide historical context and improve the model's predictive capabilities.

The dataset from Kaggle is split into training and testing sets to train the XGBoost regression model and evaluate its performance on unseen data. The model's effectiveness is assessed through feature importance and target correlation analyses, revealing which features are most influential in predicting Energy Consumption and any strong relationships between the target variable and other features. Additionally, the project involves developing visualizations to better understand the model's predictions, enabling insights into Energy Consumption patterns over time and identifying potential areas for model enhancement. Altogether, this comprehensive approach leverages machine learning to produce accurate forecasts for Energy Consumption based on historical data, making it a valuable tool for future energy consumption planning and analysis.
